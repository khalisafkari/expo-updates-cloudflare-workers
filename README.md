# **expo-updates-cloudflare-workers**

A custom server for Expo applications using **Cloudflare Workers** to handle over-the-air (OTA) updates more quickly and efficiently.

This project is designed to:
- Leverage the **speed** and **scalability** of Cloudflare Workers.
- Host and serve application update files.
- Maintain integration with **Expo Updates** service.
- **Avoid limitations imposed by platforms**, such as the 1,000 MAU (Monthly Active Users) cap, enabling it to serve a larger number of users without restrictions.
- Utilize two Cloudflare database models, **KV** and **D1**, for efficient and scalable data storage.
- **Good news**: Cloudflare offers both of these database models for **free**! If the provided resources are not enough, you have the option to **upgrade**. However, for apps with more than 1,000 daily active users, Cloudflare's provided resources are usually sufficient, depending on how the resources are used.

**Note**: This project is developed using **Bun version 1.2**. To avoid potential issues, I highly recommend using Bun as the runtime for this project.
